# GOSQAS Demo

This is experimental code for the [GOSQAS project](https://github.com/gosqas/home/blob/main/README.md).

GOSQAS is grateful to @devhawk (Harry Pierson) for rapidly protoyping this demo.

## Installation

Clone the repo, and then execute:
```
> npm install
> npm run dev
```

Then point your browser at [http:\\localhost:8000](http:\\localhost:8000) for example. 

> Note, as of v0.2, the demo server listens on *all* networks the server is connected to. 
> While exposing server ports is always a security risk, exposing the demo server on the local network
> allows other devices - mobile devices in particular - to access the demo server. 
> On startup, the server prints out a list of the IP addresses it is listening on.

## Video of Operation

We have made a [short video](https://youtu.be/E5_YQV72NyY) of [v0.1](https://github.com/gosqas/asset-provenance-tracking/releases/tag/v0.1) operation.
